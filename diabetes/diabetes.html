 Welcome to Prosper! Our goal is to prevent Type 2 Diabetes starting from the root, 
 throughout local low-income communities within people of color. Our team has learned 
 that people of color are more likely to develop Type 2 Diabetes within their lifetime, 
 due to the lack of acesss to healthy food. Thus, our target community is low-income 
 communities that live in food desserts, where finding fresh produce is difficult to 
  obtain and purchase. We are attempting to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, a chronic disease, 
 because it's most prevalent in low-income communities of color.

  This is an important problem that we want to prevent because as students of co""lor, 
  Type 2 Diabetes in low-income communities is something that affects us and the people
  we know. We believe that there has not been enough light shed on this disease and the 
  people that are at risk. Of course there is a whole cycle that keeps this system going
  which are food deserts and food insecurity. with the lack of access and education on 
  this topic, there is no doubt these communities will make the same mistakes with their
  nutritien and eating habbits. With our project we hope to bring awareness to our families,
  friends, educators and just our communities in general.
